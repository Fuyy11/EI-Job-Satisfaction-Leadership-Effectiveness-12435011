	abstract = {The green leadership (GL) concept has significantly gained popularity over the last decade. Consequently, more research has been conducted on this emerging leadership concept, emphasizing leadership styles that promote the green environment so that sustainable goals can be achieved. In the present research, leaders’ emotional intelligence (EI) is positioned as a mediating variable between GL and employees’ green organizational citizenship behavior (GOCB). The data of this research comprised managerial and non-managerial staff from the manufacturing and service industries. A PLS-SEM was used to evaluate the relationship between the various factors among 422 employees. The empirical findings indicated that GL and GOCB had a favorable and robust relationship. The results of the study also suggested that a leader’s EI mediates the influence of green leadership on their employees’ green organizational citizenship behavior. Green leadership is essential in creating sustainable environmental behaviors among employees. It can strengthen leaders’ EI, which successively helps them to garner positivity and foster an environment of mutual harmony and cooperation in the workplace to support pro-environmental policies. Overall, our study contributes to and advances previous studies and shows that green leadership plays a critical role in influencing a leader’s own EI which, in turn, predicts the green OCB of their employees in the workplace.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper investigates the relationship between managerial emotional intelligence (EI) levels and a rating of leadership effectiveness (subordinate ratings). Design/methodology/approach – The study involved administering the Mayer Salovey Caruso emotional intelligence test (MSCEIT) EI test to 38 supervisors within a large manufacturing organisation. Ratings of supervisory leadership effectiveness were assessed via subordinate ratings on an attitude survey detailing questions relating to supervisor performance. Altogether data were collated from a total of 1,258 survey responses. Findings – The overall results of the data analysis suggest that half of the MSCEIT scores may act as a strong predictor of leadership effectiveness, particularly the branches within the experiential EI domain (r=0.50, p{\textless}0.001). Interestingly, the relationship between supervisor ratings and the reasoning EI domain (r=−0.12) was not as expected. Practical implications – These findings endorse the validity of incorporating EI interventions alongside the recruitment and selection process and the training and development process of managerial personnel. However, they also question the conceptual validity of a key branch (managing emotions) of the MSCEIT. Originality/value – Although EI is viewed as a key determinant of effective leadership within leadership literature there is a relative dearth of supporting research that has not used student sample populations or a conceptually suspect model of EI within their research methodology.},

These variables are significantly associated with leader influence. Design/methodology/approach To test how employees evaluate delegation, an experimental study (study 1: n=304) and a longitudinal field questionnaire (study 2: n=109) were implemented. Findings The results of study 1 showed that leader delegation leads to higher levels of perceived leader ability and performance. Study 2 replicated and extended these results. Mediation analyses revealed that leader likeability mediates the relationship between delegation and employee’s job satisfaction. Practical implications The study emphasizes the meaning of delegation for leaders and organizations. By transferring responsibilities and decision-making responsibilities, leaders can improve their image among their employees and enhance job satisfaction. Originality/value This study investigated employees’ perceptions of leaders with regard to performance-related and affective responses to delegation. The results are combined with findings on employee job satisfaction. The study fills an important gap in leadership research. Experimental data combined with field survey data show that the delegation of responsibilities is associated with positive impressions of leaders.},

Each of these research works went on to add a perspective to JS and its measurement. The measures of JS captured various dimensions from Minnesota satisfaction questionnaire to JS survey. Further, these measures have been standardized on working professionals in various domains except the emerging field of information technology (IT). The purpose of this study was to develop and adapt a scale measuring JS of IT employees in India. The facets of JS were identified through literature and verified through experts in IT domain. The initial scale consisting of 23 items identified from the existing scales was administered on 410 employees of three IT companies in India. The scale was standardized through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). It was used to determine the factor structure and convergent and discriminant validity. Exploratory factor analysis yielded six factors: pay, training, promotion, recognition, supervision and job security. A final standardized questionnaire consists of 23 items on JS. The reliability estimates were 0.92, and convergent and discriminant validity also met all the criteria respectively. The resultant scale can be used on IT professionals in India.},

	abstract = {Emotional intelligence (EI) has been an emerging topic for psychological, educational, and management researchers and consultants in recent years. Unfortunately, there have been relatively few empirical studies on EI conducted with scientific rigor, especially in Asia. A recent study clarified the definition of EI as a set of mental abilities related to emotions, and developed a self-report EI measure by demonstrating the relationships between EI and life satisfaction, job performance, and job satisfaction for Chinese respondents. To facilitate future EI research and EI-related human resource practices in Asia, we develop an alternative EI measure in this series of four studies using forced choice items. Scenarios with alternative responses showing different levels of EI were generated in the first study, and 20 items were selected empirically. In the second study, pairs of abilities were generated and 20 EI items were paired with various ability facets. In the third study, we examined the social desirability of the 40 items developed in the first two studies. In the fourth study, these 40 EI items were cross-validated. The results indicated that this forced choice EI-scale had acceptable convergent, discriminant and predictive validity using life satisfaction, job performance, and job satisfaction as criterion variables. We discussed the implications of our findings in the conclusion. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {Leaders have got a significant role to play in all spheres of life. An organization can attain remarkable achievements under a strong leadership; whereas, the presence of unsuccessful leaders can prove to be quite detrimental. The notion that a vital part is played by emotional intelligence (EI) in the effectiveness of leaders has been introduced recently. An emotionally stable professional is able to cope up with imperfection and uncertainty, since he is not very critical and believes in win-win situation. He has the ability to handle every sort of situation whether it is a demanding job, an atrocious boss, or undisciplined subordinates. At present, the definition of leadership has become more people-focused. A person with good understanding of Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ) is expected to be an excellent team person and thus an effective leader. This paper is aimed at unifying the literature that evaluates the possible connection between leadership effectiveness and EI. A survey in the college of Haryana is conducted based on Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue), which is psychometrically certified and provides self-awareness regarding EI. For the same, 50 teachers (leaders and non-leaders) were asked to fill the questionnaire. A SPSS analysis is carried out for evaluating the claims regarding significant relationship of EI with leadership, and to analyse the worth of EI in the success of professional and personal life of a leader. The impact of EI has been analysed on the perception, expression, and management of emotions, adaptability, relationships, stress management, self-motivation, happiness, empathy, and optimism. It is revealed through the results that a positive relationship exists between effective leadership and EI, which is beneficial for all the parties involved in the loop. Moreover, a noticeable difference has been observed in the EIQ rating of leaders and non-leaders in the way they utilize their EI in dealing with their personal matters or interacting with others.},

On s’intéresse au statut supposé de l’I.E. dans la performance au travail, la satisfaction et l’évaluation de la carrière et des compétences (surtout dans la domaine de la sélection et de l’orientation). Globalement, cette revue de questions prouve que les recherches récentes ont fait de grands pas dans la comprehénsion de l’utilité de l’I.E. au travail. Les preuves strictement scientifiques sont cependant insuffisantes, la littérature accordant une confiance excessive aux avis d’experts, aux anecdotes, aux études de cas et aux enquêtes privées non publiées. On propose, à la fin de l’article, quelques directives pratiques pour favoriser le développement et l’utilisation de mesures de l’I.E. dans les situations professionnelles. This paper critically reviews conceptualisations and empirical evidence in support of emotional intelligence (EI) and its claimed role in the occupational environment. Consideration is given to the purported status of EI in occupational and career assessment (with particular emphasis on personnel selection and placement), job performance, and satisfaction. Overall, this review demonstrates that recent research has made important strides towards understanding the usefulness of EI in the workplace. However, the ratio of hyperbole to hard evidence is high, with over-reliance in the literature on expert opinion, anecdote, case studies, and unpublished proprietary surveys. The review concludes by providing a number of practical guidelines for the development and implementation of EI measures within occupational settings.},

Intelligence Quotient is a measure for a person's intelligence whereas Emotional Intelligence (EI), measured as an Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EQ), describes a concept that involves the ability, capacity, skill or a self-perceived ability, to identify, assess, and manage the emotions of one’s self, of others, and of groups.

	isbn = {978-0-429-32575-5},
	abstract = {Job satisfaction continues to be one of the most studied job attitudes in Industrial and Organizational Psychology (Judge et al., 2017). Academics and practitioners alike have recognized the worth of job satisfaction, given its usefulness in predicting vital organizational effectiveness outcomes (Judge \& Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012; Society for Human Resource Management, 2015). In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the job satisfaction literature. First, we discuss the history of job satisfaction and how the construct has been explicated and refined over time. Second, we describe the various paradigms and approaches to the measurement of job satisfaction, along with important measurement considerations. Third, we review the antecedents (dispositional, contextual, and event-based) and outcomes (performance, effectiveness, organizational citizenship behavior [OCB], counterproductive work behavior [CWB], and withdrawal) of job satisfaction. Finally, we synthesize decades of job satisfaction research to suggest how the study of job satisfaction can move forward. As some examples, we suggest researchers employ theory elaboration (Fisher \& Aguinis, 2017) approaches to prune and elaborate on job satisfaction theory and that researchers continue to delve into clarifying the role of affect in job satisfaction. We also suggest that practitioners closely focus on the determinants of job satisfaction, especially justice perceptions, which strongly predict job satisfaction. We conclude that a continued focus on job satisfaction is critically important: in the tumultuous modern climate wrought with high turnover rates, satisfied employees are more likely to be loyal champions, ambassadors, and advocates to their organizations.},

	abstract = {Learning about factors that influence staff retention and ways of improving it, can help organizations avoid the inconvenience of high attrition. The employee’s job satisfaction and retention are the main factors for the success and survival of any firm. No one can measure the level of satisfaction an individual get why he performs his work. But there are factors which directly or indirectly affect the satisfaction level of employees at workplace. Companies that constitute work environment that attract, motivate, and retain talented employees will be better positioned to succeed in today’s competitive business world that demands quality and cost-efficiency. The main challenges that organizations are facing today is not only managing its human resources but also satisfying and retaining them. Securing and retaining skilled workforce plays an important role for any organization, because the knowledge and skills of employees have become highly essential in gaining competitive advantage in today’s business environment. Thus, the objective of this paper was to: examine the factors which affect the job satisfaction of employees. Determine the affect of job satisfaction on employees’ retention and suggest recommendations on possible ways to improve employees’ retention. Also, the essential of having a retention strategy, which is based on a well enunciated human resource management system, was emphasized.},

	abstract = {The present study investigates the functions of experience and educational level on job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is defined as the emotional feeling of an employee towards his job. Further, Job satisfaction is defined as an affective reaction to a job that results from the comparison of perceived outcomes with those that are desired. It is a psychological attachment of an employee with his job. The study first examines the theoretical understanding of demographic variables \& job satisfaction, followed by an empirical investigation. The data was collected by using standardised scale: Job Satisfaction Scale (Spector, 1985). The study covers middle and senior level executives of PSU and Private sector organizations. Descriptive statistics, Correlation, T-test, and ANOVA were employed on the collected data to find out the answer of research questions and to achieve the research objectives. The finding of the study divulges that no significant difference exists between difference experience groups as well in different level of educational groups, related to job satisfaction. But deep enquiry of results clearly shows that few dimensions of job satisfaction have significant difference in various experience and educational groups. This study is a contribution in extant literature pool of demographic study of job satisfaction. It will also enhance the understanding of job satisfaction in Indian organizations. Subjects of the study are bound to the top and middle level employees. Similar study can be done on lower level of employee to find out more favourable results. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {This study investigates how job satisfaction and turnover intentions are related to external reputation as perceived by employees and their pride in membership. Based on a cross-sectional survey including 439 employees, it also provides insights into external reputation as a possible source of collective pride. Study results indicate that, in agreement with social identity theory, outsiders' views of the organization are closely associated with employees' pride in organizational membership as well as job satisfaction. Both pride and job satisfaction mediate the relationship between perceived external reputation and turnover intentions. Hence, a favourable reputation matters in managing turnover intentions and is closely related to employee pride and satisfaction. Tenure of employees is positively associated with pride while intensive customer contact is negatively related to perceived external reputation and pride. Implications pinpoint the need for alignment of reputation management and human resources management. Furthermore, managers need to focus on new staff and employees with frequent customer contact and should implement pride-building strategies according to the tenure of employees and intensity of customer contact.},

	abstract = {Background: A vast number of published studies have suggested a link between job satisfaction levels and health. The sizes of the relationships reported vary widely. Narrative overviews of this relationship have been published, but no systematic meta-analysis review has been conducted. , Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 485 studies with a combined sample size of 267 995 individuals was conducted, evaluating the research evidence linking self-report measures of job satisfaction to measures of physical and mental wellbeing. , Results: The overall correlation combined across all health measures was r = 0.312 (0.370 after Schmidt-Hunter adjustment). Job satisfaction was most strongly associated with mental/psychological problems; strongest relationships were found for burnout (corrected r = 0.478), self-esteem(r = 0.429), depression (r = 0.428), and anxiety(r = 0.420). The correlation with subjective physical illness was more modest (r = 0.287). , Conclusions: Correlations in excess of 0.3 are rare in this context. The relationships found suggest that job satisfaction level is an important factor influencing the health of workers. Organisations should include the development of stress management policies to identify and eradicate work practices that cause most job dissatisfaction as part of any exercise aimed at improving employee health. Occupational health clinicians should consider counselling employees diagnosed as having psychological problems to critically evaluate their work—and help them to explore ways of gaining greater satisfaction from this important aspect of their life.},

The results indicate that job satisfaction levels varied across corporate cultural typology.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of leadership behaviours on employee outcomes in Singapore. Very little research related to this subject has been done in health care settings in this country. The comparison of the results of the different types of settings and samples will allow a better understanding of the relationshiop between leadership behaviours and employee outcomes and thus help to determine if leadership is worth the extra effort. Method The study explored the relationships between five leadership behaviours identified by Kouzes and Posner and the employee outcomes of registered nurses practising in the general wards, intensive care units and the coronary care unit in an acute hospital. Survey questionnaires were used to elicit responses from 100 registered nurses and 20 managers belonging to the organization. Data collected included demographic characteristics and the degree to which the five types of leadership behaviours were used as perceived by the nurse managers and the registered nurses. In addition, the level of nurse job satisfaction, the degree of productivity and the extent of organizational commitment are described. Findings The findings show a similar trend to the original studies in the United States of America. Use of leadership behaviours and employee outcomes were significantly correlated. The regression results indicate that 29\% of job satisfaction, 22\% of organizational commitment and 9\% of productivity were explained by the use of leadership behaviours. Recommendations are made in the light of these findings.},

I show that clearly separating these constructs is consistent with current, basic research and theory on attitudes as well as with current research and theory on ‘‘subjective wellbeing’’ (SWB). I also argue that the separation of the constructs can produce better criterion predictions than job satisfaction has by itself, suggests new areas of research that cannot be envisioned when satisfaction and affect are treated as equivalent constructs, and requires the development of new measurement systems.

It is argued that a major reason for this lack of progress is the implicit conception of causality accepted by most psychologists. It is called the policy of “correlation without explanation.” The present approach to the topic of job attitudes emphasizes a more conceptual approach to the problem. Using Rand's theory of emotions as a starting point, the concepts of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, value, emotion, and appraisal, and their interrelationships are discussed. The present theory of job satisfaction is contrasted with previous theories. Data illustrating an approach to satisfaction based on the present theory are given. Other issues discussed are: value hierarchies; the dynamic character of values; overall job satisfaction; the Herzberg two-factor theory; the measurement of satisfaction and values; and rational vs. irrational values.},

In this case, the need for ensuring employee job satisfaction becomes a matter of necessity to every organisation. Though, studies have been conducted by various researchers and scholars in this area, there is however the need to conduct more studies on job satisfaction and performance of an employee since the employees are believed to be an indispensable part of an organisation. Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationship between job satisfaction and performance of non-academic staff of Bauchi State University Gadau Nigeria (BASUG). Dissatisfaction is believed to be one of the major factors that demotivates and demoralise employee in the workplace which can result to lower productivity thereby affecting the overall performance of the organisation. Consequently an aggregate of two hundred and seventy questionnaires were distributed non- academic staff of BASUG based on systematic random sampling and data collected is analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The outcome of the analysis depicts that there is positive and significant relationship between job satisfactions on the performance of non- academic staff of the University. The study will serve as a policy guide to the management of the Nigerian Universities in areas relating to employee performance improvement through job satisfaction and it will also further make an impetus the field of organisational behaviour and human resource management.},

This aim is accomplished using the latest Work Orientations data set from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). The survey was conducted in 1997 and, in this paper, data for 21 countries are used. The main results are: (i) workers in all countries are quite satisfied; this result also applies to the five Eastern European countries analyzed here. (ii) Denmark is the country with the highest job-satisfaction level. The United States is ranked seventh, Great Britain fifteenth, Japan nineteenth, and Russia twentieth. (iii) A comparison with the 1989 ISSP data set reveals that job satisfaction has declined in Germany and the United States in the 1990s.

	abstract = {Purpose – Previously, researchers have performed studies on job satisfaction and organizational behavior outcomes in Western contexts. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether economic prosperity or cultural perspective may explain why job satisfaction may not be an effective predictor of organizational outcomes in Greater China. Researchers need more empirical evidence to understand the nature of the relationship between job satisfaction and work outcomes in a non‐Western context in general and in Greater China in particular. Design/methodology/approach – The paper represents a conceptual work that draws on the metrical literature review within the field of organizational behavior. Findings – Review of empirical studies regarding job satisfaction shows that in Greater China, including Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, job satisfaction has a different meaning than those presented in Western organizational behavior literature. The differences in the meaning of job satisfaction between Western interpretation and Eastern (i.e. Chinese) interpretation can be explained by differing Western and Eastern cultural values rather than stages of economic development. Thus, both scholars and practitioners are able to re‐examine the concept, construct and correlates between job satisfaction and its organizational outcomes in Greater China. Practical implications – The paper has implications for global management awareness in understanding complex meanings of job satisfaction and work outcomes in multinational enterprises and international joint ventures in Greater China. Originality/value – The paper's findings raise awareness of potential shortcomings in using Western concepts, models and practices in Greater China and other non‐Western cultures. Moreover, it highlights the importance of cultural context and a need for further research in the area of organizational behavior from a Chinese cultural perspective.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study examined the relationship of the organizational variables of structure, technology, and environment with job satisfaction among public health nurses in a southeastern state.
Background: There is little research on the characteristics of the work environment that influence nurses to remain in the public health work setting. Prior research in this setting has focused on the negative aspects of the nursing positions. These aspects of least desirability for the public health nurse provide only a partial view of job satisfaction. To decide and plan specific strategies, the nurse administrator must have valid and useful information about the positive aspects of job satisfaction of public health nurses.
Methods: The researchers distributed a questionnaire to all licensed nursing personnel employed by a state public health department. Data collection consisted of four tools: 1) structure instrument; 2) technology instrument; 3) environmental uncertainty instrument; and 4) McCloskey-Mueller Job Satisfaction Scale (MMSS). The sample of 838 public health nurses (response rate of 50.6\%) included representation from all 13 districts and the central office of the public health department.
Results: Significant relationships were found between job satisfaction and the demographic variables of nurse category (registered nurse and licensed practical nurse) and years of experience with the public health department. The critical variable for predicting job satisfaction in this group of public health nurses was organizational structure (vertical participation, horizontal participation, and formalization). Dimensions of structures accounted for 41\% of the variance in job satisfaction. Structure remained the critical predictor of job satisfaction, although the findings do not suggest a conclusive model. The three dimensions of technology (instability, variability, and uncertainty) and environmental uncertainty assumed significance only in concert with each other or with the dimensions of structure.
Conclusions: This study contributes to nursing management theory by examining the relationship of organizational structure, technology, and environmental uncertainty with job satisfaction in public health nurses. This research also has implications for nurse administrators in public health for creating more flexible work environments and facilitating staff involvement in decision making.},

The objective of this study is to identify the factors that affect the job satisfaction of employees and to analyze the impact of compensation, organizational policy, working condition, job stress and promotion opportunities on job satisfaction of employees. The findings of the study suggest that the taken factors have explained the job satisfaction and the policy framers and managers have to think about inclusion of the factors that affect satisfaction to enhance their business.

The purpose of the study is to find the job satisfaction level, its impact on loyalty and the factors affecting it, to help efficient and effective management system in the developing countries like Pakistan. A model was developed which includes the factors affecting job satisfaction, their relations and effects on job loyalty. Questionnaire was developed to collect the data for job satisfaction level in various organizations. Convenient sampling was used and 148 questionnaires were filled from the employees of different private and public organizations. Statistically, Reward and recognition and workplace environment were most influencing factors to Job` satisfaction, but participation in decision making and job satisfaction has insignificant relationship. Moreover, there is also positive relation between job satisfaction and job loyalty. Human resource management (HRM) claims to measure job satisfaction in developed or multi-national companies. Definitely, in under developed countries like Pakistan, these applications are rarely used. So, this paper supports use of HRM applications in the developing countries. It will help managers to better understand satisfaction level of employees and can motivate them.},

To ensure continued organisational performance and to maintain the competitive advantage, organisations must therefore constantly implement changes in strategy, structure, process and culture (Higgs, 2002; Langley, 2000). Goleman (1998) proposes a solution of self-awareness as a key skill in handling stress, thereby indicating that a lack of emotional intelligence in such an unstable environment means possible failure that can impact on everyone’s future. The general aim of this research was to determine whether there is a relationship between emotional intelligence and stress management in a group of managers. This was done through a quantitative study of the relationship between stress management and emotional intelligence. These constructs were operationalised by means of a combination of scales present in the Feelings and Emotions domain of the Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ32i) and the Emotional Quotient Inventory (Bar-On EQ-i). The correlation and regression results seem to indicate that stress management (the ability to cope with stress) is a component of emotional intelligence, while stress can be either an input or an outflow of emotional intelligence or the lack thereof.},

Participants were 575 students at 2 Chinese universities, who completed measures of coping with stress, self-leadership, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy, and positive affect. The structural equation model analysis results indicated that self-efficacy fully mediated the relationship between emotional intelligence and active coping, as we had predicted. Further, self-leadership had a direct effect on active coping. However, positive affect and self-efficacy did not mediate the relationship between self-leadership and coping with stress.

Comparison of group factor structures revealed satisfactory congruence coefficients for the four trait EI factors of Well-being, Sociability, Emotionality, and Self-control. In addition, results showed pronounced cross-cultural variation in global trait EI scores, with British participants scoring consistently higher than their Chinese counterparts. Results from the Chinese sample also yielded support for the cultural accommodation effect, viz. that multilingual individuals respond in a manner that favours or conforms to the culture associated with the language of the questionnaire.

It specifically looks at the current definitions of leadership and looks at some historical background information relating to the more common theories that relate to leadership and effectiveness. It also delves into some of the more traditional leadership theories as well as some of the more modern day theories and attempts to identify why there is still a considerable absence in top military leadership by female officers. Of the 284 Air Force general officers on active duty today, there are only 7 females among them, for a 2\% representation. My claim is that there is more of a hidden bias by men against women than there is a logical reason for this underrepresentation of women in the senior ranks. This paper focuses on this sensitive subject area, and hopefully raises readers’ awareness of the presence of this bias that still exits today.},

In order to evaluate the personal values profile a closed instrument of the rank order type has been developed and applied. To identify the predominant leadership styles, as well as the leadership effectiveness of the involved executives, it has been used as an instrument available in the market. To verify the relationship between personal values balance and leadership effectiveness, the linear regression method has been used computing the linear correlation coefficient between the before mentioned variables, involving 400 executives. The study has shown that the executives have an unbalance in their personal values profile, with predominance of economic and theoretical values. Additionally the study has uncovered lack of flexibility regarding the leadership styles, presenting styles of selling and sharing ideas as dominants. The study also showed that the leadership effectiveness of the involved executives was at a moderate level. Finally, the research pointed out a high positive relationship between personal values balance and leadership effectiveness, and, furthermore, it showed a better balance of personal values, if one considered only the part of the sample involving executives working in organizations which presented better results in the three previous years (50 executives).},

	abstract = {Leadership being the ability to influence a group may manifest its effectiveness in several ways, ranging from financial performance to employee morale and commitment. A number of theories have evolved by integrating contemporary socioeconomic and cultural changes occurring in the business environment. India has been witnessing a significant transformation, which was triggered by new economic thinking pursued by the policy makers. The liberalization coupled with emerging realities has significantly influenced Indian business. Not only has it changed the strategic organizational perspectives, the composition of workforce has also changed with increasing diversity. The technological evolution has completely transformed the processes of both manufacturing and service industries. The recent changes have posed fresh questions. Heightened competition, decreasing bottom lines, demanding customers and other similar pressures have precipitated enormous challenges for the role of leadership in today's organizations. It still remains to be seen how these leaders will cope with such a demanding environment, where they may be tempted to look for short cuts without caring for the values or ethical concerns of the society at large. The constitution of effectiveness itself may be changing and it, therefore, needs to be looked into for more clarity. It is in this context that the present study was undertaken to explore and compare the factors constituting leadership effectiveness in manufacturing and service industries. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Purpose – This study sets out to investigate the leadership roles, the predictors of leadership effectiveness for Chinese managers, and the relative effects of gender and rater differences on perceived leadership roles. The study is important as it seeks to investigate whether a leadership model (the Integrated Competing Values Framework) developed for Western cultures explains the leadership behaviours of Chinese managers. Design/methodology/approach – Using a 360° feedback method, the data for the study were collected from 49 middle managers and 142 of their significant others (boss, peers and staff). The data were submitted to a repeated measures ANOVA, with role displayed and position as the within‐subjects factors and gender as the between‐subjects factor, to determine whether there were any significant main or interaction effects. A standard multiple regression was performed, between the effectiveness as the outcome and the leadership roles. This was followed by a forward regression analysis. Findings – The empirical evidence shows significant differences in the extent to which the leadership roles were displayed. Chinese managers were focused most on getting the job done (deliverer) and monitoring performance (monitor) followed by developing staff (developer) and developing networks (broker). Being innovative (innovator) was the least displayed leadership role. The managers showed moderate reflective capability (integrator) and moderate effectiveness. They rated themselves higher than did their bosses, peers and staff. Their bosses also rated the managers' leadership behaviours higher than did the peers and staff. However, there was no significant difference between men and women in their leadership roles displayed or effectiveness. In the forward regression, the developer contributed relatively most to the prediction of effectiveness. Originality/value – The study contributes to the literature on cultural and institutional effects on leadership behaviour and effectiveness. The findings show that cultural and institutional differences do significantly affect variability in leadership behaviour associated with leadership effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to call for a rhetorical turn in the study of school leadership and discusses how principals use language to enact school improvement. The key purpose is to explore how talk is action in leading and managing school reform. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a rhetorical framework and methodology for interpreting principal practice through language. As a model, the language use of one urban school principal is examined through a rhetorical analysis of 650 instances of principal talk in 14 administrative meetings. The paper reports on the form and content of principal rhetoric, including analysis of logos, pathos, and ethos, and comparative analysis across meeting contexts. Findings The paper demonstrates the importance of rhetorical form and content and highlights the role of audience in principal talk. In the present example, each of three rhetorical forms was used to transform school practice. Logos was used most frequently; emotional and ethical arguments were also integral to principal talk. Comparative analysis showed that the principal's rhetoric varied by audience. The principal's use of language did not just explain practice, but also defined and shaped ongoing practices. Research limitations/implications The author proposes future cross-case research to develop an understanding of how leadership language varies across individuals and contexts, as well as interaction analyses of the co-performance of discourse and rhetoric in schools. Practical implications The author argues that principal preparation would benefit from the incorporation of the linguistic concepts and forms of rhetoric, particularly in the context of school improvement. Originality/value While many have turned to principal practice as an area of research, few have focussed on the underlying linguistic structures. This paper emphasizes the importance of language in principal practice and offers a specific methodology with which to study it.},

I review empirical research in leader group prototypicality, concluding there is a robust empirical basis for the key propositions of the social identity theory of leadership. I also identify newer developments that extend and enrich the social identity analysis of leadership, including attention to the roles of uncertainty, leader fairness, leader–follower relationship, leader self-perceived prototypicality, and leadership of creativity and innovation.},

A self- administered survey was conducted to collect data from three major cities in the region, namely Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taipei (N = 380). Work stressors were negatively related to work well-being, whereas CWV were positively related to work well-being. In addition, CWV also demonstrated moderating effects in some of the stressor–job satisfaction relationships.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {The effective orientation which an employee has towards his or her work has been described as job satisfaction. In other words, it is an affective reaction to a job that results from the comparison of perceived outcomes with those that are desired. The purpose of this study is to examine the level of job satisfaction among district-No.1 staffs of Zahedan municipality of Iran and define the relationships between Job Descriptive Index questionnaire (JDI)’s five involved parameters and job satisfaction and potential biographical variables on the staff retention. Moreover, finding the main effective involved factors regarding area and organization’s culture is another objective which may ease understanding the area’s working atmosphere. The Job Descriptive Index questionnaire was administered to gather data. The JDI measures job satisfaction on five job facets, namely, pay, promotions, supervision, co-workers and the work itself. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. The results of the present study indicated that there is no significant relationship between two biographical variables, age and gender, and job satisfaction. Therefore, the relationship between biographical variables and job satisfaction level should be investigated in every country, based on its own economical level and cultural background. Considering culture of the area, with very complicated human behavior of Asian pattern, it was expected that there would be a significant relationship between participant’s direct supervisor and their job satisfaction level. Significant relationship between salary and opportunity for promotion which is in close connection to the salary and job satisfaction among Zahedan municipality employees, has been seen, it seems that, the poverty of this deprived area and literacy level of employees do influence these involved parameters. This study also indicated that there is a significant relationship between co-workers and their job satisfaction level. The findings strengthen the argument that organizations should engage in the integration of employees so as to create group cohesion among employees and departments within the organization. It is also notable that absenteeism is regarded as withdrawal behavior when it is used as a way to escape an undesirable working environment.},

	abstract = {Background: Nurses suffer from stress and health problems owing to the characteristics of their work and their contact with patients and death. Since emotions can have an effect on work outcomes, emotional intelligence (EI) may explain the individual differences in dealing with work stress.
Objectives: This study investigated the interrelationships among EI, work stress and health. We also examined the impact of socio-demographic variables (e.g. age, gender, length of service,y) on stress and nurses’ health. Design: A questionnaire survey (anonymous) has been carried out to detect these interrelationships. Setting: A general public hospital in Spain Participants: One hundred and eighty nurses.
Methods: Data was gathered on demographic information and work, stress, health and EI. Beyond descriptive statistics, analyses of variance, mean differences and regression analyses were computed.
Results: Findings show a differential effect of the EI components in stress and health. As far as stress is concerned, the results show that the nurses who score high in clarity and emotional repair report less stress, whereas those with high scores in attention to emotions experience greater levels of stress. Furthermore, we ﬁnd a positive relationship between age, length of service and stress, with younger nurses and those with a shorter length of service experiencing less stress. However, EI and health are not related to age or to length of service. Also, we ﬁnd that married nurses report better general health.
Conclusions: EI is shown for nurses as a protective factor against stress and a facilitative factor for health (especially the Clarity and Repair dimensions). These comments could be especially important in training future professionals in these abilities.},

	abstract = {Background. Nursing education in Hong Kong has undergone major reform in recent years, similar to that in Australia and the United Kingdom (UK), involving the introduction of degree level preparation. Although there were some changes in the nursing education system, the reform was considered slow. While a combination of complex factors contributed to the reform, the effects of nurse leaders was instrumental in influencing policy development. Aim. This study investigated the factors that influenced the effectiveness of nursing leadership in the reform of nursing education in Hong Kong. Design. A case study approach was used. Methods of data collection included document search and semi-structured interviews (n = 27). The time frame of the study extended from the first proposal of nursing degree programme in the year 1985 to 2000 by which 200 nursing degree places were secured. Results. Situational variables that impacted on leadership effectiveness were categorized as barriers and facilitators. Barriers were related to nursing professional socialization in a health care system that was dominated by the medical profession. Facilitators were related to socio-politic-economical changes in the wider environment. Conclusion. This study suggests the importance of education, positive socialization and unity in promoting nursing leadership development.},

Design/methodology/approach Using a survey method, this study collected primary data from organizations across several regions in China. The data were analyzed to detect possible relationships among institutional force, organizational culture and knowledge management process in Chinese organizations. More specifically, to what extent are these relationships moderated by national culture? Findings While knowledge management practices in China were partly influenced by institutional forces, most of the predicted connections between organizational culture and knowledge management were supported. In addition, the dynamic nature of national culture is predominant, that pervasively influencing knowledge management processes and thus contextualization determines how knowledge is being managed in China. Indeed, the ideologies of relationships and trust are key vehicles for knowledge management in the Chinese organizations. Practical implications This study comprehensively reviews existing literature to form an integrative framework, which is under explored in a Chinese context. Such initiative helps scholars and practitioners to gain a full understanding of knowledge management, in general, in the Chinese business environment in particular. Originality/value This paper provides a detailed and empirical insight into the knowledge management practices in Chinese organizations and suggests that knowledge management in a distinctive and yet diverse cultural context should be considered with caution.},

To measure spontaneous creativity, participants were asked to come up with brief captions for two New Yorker cartoons. Three independent judges rated all captions along 10 continuous creativity dimensions. Participants also completed Gosling?s brief measure of the Big Five. In a sample of 265 adults from around the world, the reading the mind in the eyes emerged as significantly and positively predictive of 9 of the 10 creativity indices. Regression analyses demonstrated that these relationships existed after controlling for gender and age of participant. Further, of the Big Five traits, conscientiousness emerged as negatively related to several indices of creativity. Implications for the relationship between social-perceptual processes (e.g., empathic accuracy) and social-productive processes (e.g., spontaneous creativity) are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study examines the nexus between Confucianism, the choice of the leadership successor, and firm performance in family firms in China. It provides original evidence that firm founders who are deeply influenced by Confucianism have a higher likelihood of choosing a family member or a guanxi-connected nonfamily member as the successor. Moreover, family/guanxi-connected suc­ cessors have a positive effect on firm performance compared with their counterparts outside of the family/guanxi circle. One underlying reason is that, affected by Confucianism, only the family/guanxi-connected successors can acquire the founder's specialized assets via pre-succession internal managerial experience, which, in turn, enables them to outperform other successors.},

In this respect, current paper aims to point out some consequences of transformational leadership in various cultures. As a result, it has been observed that because of its charismatic and simulative characteristics, these leaders are more effective on developed countries and innovative characteristics rather than group oriented and depressed cultures.},

Employee responses from 463 organizations show that the training can affect leadership behavior positively in very different organizations (primary and secondary schools, daycare centers, tax centers, and bank units). Furthermore, for the subsample of school principals, we find some evidence of training effects on performance in standardized tests in elementary schools and final exams in lower secondary schools.

	abstract = {As society evolves, people are making more of an effort to learn more about human aspects, one of which is emotional intelligence, a topic on which education experts have traditionally concentrated. This is due to the fact that emotional intelligence has a significant impact on how people think and manage their emotions. On the other side, it promotes the development of expressive ability and aids people in better adapting to life. This study explores the relationship between communication skills, leadership skills, stress management, adaptability, and emotional intelligence of FPT University students to determine the factors that affect students' emotional intelligence. To survey 500 FPT University students, this study used a sample size of 500. Previous studies used a 5-point Likert scale to assess the four skill elements. According to the results, students who completed the survey showed adequate communication skills, leadership qualities, stress management, adaptability, and emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is influenced by communication skills, leadership abilities, stress management, and flexibility. This suggests that students who master these four skills have higher levels of emotional intelligence. The outcomes of this study reveal that students have been conscious of Emotional Intelligence since a young age. The affirmations in this research paper will benefit students and young people interested in enhancing complimentary soft skills that boost Emotional Intelligence.},

We study the social/environmental reports produced by three New Zealand companies during a wider discursive struggle over the ‘proper’ role of business in society. We argue that persuasive strategies facilitate the social effects of ‘middle ground’ discourse by making business-centred understandings of social responsibility and sustainability appear reasonable and business organisations appear trustworthy in their pursuit of sustainable development. This study complements discourse analyses of social/environmental reporting by providing a finer-grained picture of how language use influences how social actors think, feel and act.},

	abstract = {Persuasive communication is a form of communication that aims to influence the attitudes, beliefs, and behavior of the audience. However, the effectiveness of persuasive communication depends on the communicator's ability to convey the message persuasively and convincingly. Emotional intelligence is an individual's ability to recognize, understand, and manage one's own emotions as well as the emotions of others. This study aimed to examine the effect of the use of emotional intelligence on the effectiveness of persuasive communication. This study used an experimental method with a pretest-posttest control group design. The study participants consisted of 60 college students who were randomly divided into experimental groups and control groups. The experimental group was given emotional intelligence training for 3 days, while the control group was not given training. Afterwards, both groups were asked to make persuasive presentations on controversial social issues. Assessment of the effectiveness of persuasive communication is carried out by an independent jury. The results showed that there was a significant difference between the effectiveness of persuasive communication of the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group produced a more persuasive and convincing presentation compared to the control group. This suggests that the use of emotional intelligence can increase the effectiveness of persuasive communication. This research has important implications for persuasive communication practitioners, especially in terms of training and developing persuasive communication skills. Emotional intelligence training can improve communicators' ability to recognize audience emotions, understand their needs and wants, and manage their own emotions in persuasive communication situations},

	abstract = {Machine learning has been the corner stone in analysing and extracting information from data and often a problem of missing values is encountered. Missing values occur because of various factors like missing completely at random, missing at random or missing not at random. All these may result from system malfunction during data collection or human error during data pre-processing. Nevertheless, it is important to deal with missing values before analysing data since ignoring or omitting missing values may result in biased or misinformed analysis. In literature there have been several proposals for handling missing values. In this paper, we aggregate some of the literature on missing data particularly focusing on machine learning techniques. We also give insight on how the machine learning approaches work by highlighting the key features of missing values imputation techniques, how they perform, their limitations and the kind of data they are most suitable for. We propose and evaluate two methods, the k nearest neighbor and an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on the random forest algorithm. Evaluation is performed on the Iris and novel power plant fan data with induced missing values at missingness rate of 5\% to 20\%. We show that both missForest and the k nearest neighbor can successfully handle missing values and offer some possible future research direction.},

Several scales commonly used in marketing researches were tested, using a bootstrapping technique. Results show that important differences in the values of Cronbach Alpha are possible due to indirect influence from external factors - respondents’ age, gender, level of study, religiousness, rural/urban living, survey type and relevance of the research subject for the participants to the survey.},

However, prior work in the area has paid little attention to how CSR initiatives should be implemented inside the organization. Against this backdrop, this study examines the impact of CSR initiatives on an important stakeholder group—employees. We build and test a comprehensive multilevel framework that focuses on whether employees derive job satisfaction from CSR programs. The proposed model predicts that a manager’s charismatic leadership influences employees’ interpretations about the motives underlying their companies’ engagement in CSR initiatives (intrinsic and extrinsic CSR-induced attributions) which, in turn, influence employee job satisfaction. Hierarchical linear modeling of data from 47 organizational units comprising 438 employees from three world-leading manufacturing organizations shows that when employees think that their manager possesses charismatic leadership qualities, they tend to attribute the organization’s motives for engaging in CSR activities to intrinsic values, which, in turn, are positively associated with job satisfaction. Also, the extent to which managers are perceived as charismatic leaders relates positively to job satisfaction. Interestingly, CSR-induced extrinsic attributions are neither explained by charismatic leadership nor do they predict job satisfaction. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed.},

	abstract = {ORIENTATION

Empirical evidence supports the notion that emotional intelligence (EI) and transformational leadership (TFL) are related and confirms the positive effect of this leadership style on follower attitudes and performance. However, more insight is needed into the nomological net of variables that affect outcomes of effective leadership, as experienced by the follower of a leader who exhibits TFL behaviours, being influenced by various EI competencies.

RESEARCH PURPOSE

This study developed and tested a structural model that depicts the nature of the relationships between EI competencies, TFL behaviours and three outcomes of effective leadership.

MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY

We argued that more insight into how (1) different components of EI affect TFL behaviours, and how (2) different components of TFL behaviours, in turn, affect outcomes of effective leadership, could be valuable in designing targeted interventions to increase employee commitment, job satisfaction (JS) and perceived supervisor support (PSS).

RESEARCH DESIGN/DESIGN AND METHOD

The cross-sectional data included a sample of 267 respondents, with 85 leader–follower dyads that were analysed with partial least squares modelling. Self and other ratings were employed.

MAIN FINDINGS

Nine of the 19 postulated relationships in the structural model were supported. Three of the four TFL components were shown to be influenced by various components of EI. Only PSS was significantly affected by idealised influence as a TFL behaviour.

PRACTICAL/MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS

Increased understanding of which EI competencies influence TFL behaviours may be useful in the development of leaders by guiding targeted EI intervention strategies to increase leadership effectiveness.

CONTRIBUTION / VALUE-ADD

This study confirmed the notion that EI competencies seem to be hierarchically ordered, whilst also providing insight into the differential impact of these competencies on TFL behaviours.},

	title = {Effectiveness of broad and specific leadership behaviors},
	volume = {48},
	doi = {10.1108/PR-03-2018-0100},
	abstract = {Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to determine how task-oriented, relations-oriented and change-oriented leader behaviors are related to managerial effectiveness and subordinate job satisfaction, to identify incorrect findings in a recent meta-analysis of these relationships and to verify that leader problem solving is an important task-oriented behavior.

Design/methodology/approach

In total, 235 employees were surveyed to measure 11 specific behaviors used by their leader, and again two weeks later to measure the two outcome variables. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess how the leader behaviors are related to each outcome.

Findings

Task-oriented, relations-oriented and change-oriented behaviors were all related significantly to managerial effectiveness, but only relations-oriented behavior was related significantly to subordinate job satisfaction. Problem solving was the task-oriented behavior with the strongest relationship to managerial effectiveness. Recognizing was the least important relations-oriented behavior for job satisfaction.

Research limitations/implications

Limitations included a convenience sample, common source data and possible effects of unmeasured situational variables. Ways to avoid these limitations in future research are suggested.

Practical implications

The findings can be used to improve leadership training and development for most managers.

Originality/value

The results support the idea that examining specific leader behaviors in addition to broad meta-categories can improve leadership theory, research and training.},

	abstract = {The cross-sectional research design, especially when used with self-report surveys, is held in low esteem despite its widespread use. It is generally accepted that the longitudinal design offers considerable advantages and should be preferred due to its ability to shed light on causal connections. In this paper, I will argue that the ability of the longitudinal design to reflect causality has been overstated and that it offers limited advantages over the cross-sectional design in most cases in which it is used. The nature of causal inference from a philosophy of science perspective is used to illustrate how cross-sectional designs can provide evidence for relationships among variables and can be used to rule out many potential alternative explanations for those relationships. Strategies for optimizing the use of cross-sectional designs are noted, including the inclusion of control variables to rule out spurious relationships, the addition of alternative sources of data, and the incorporation of experimental methods. Best practice advice is offered for the use of both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as for authors writing and for reviewers evaluating papers that report results of cross-sectional studies.},
